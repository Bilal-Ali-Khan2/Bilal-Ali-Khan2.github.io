    <div class="aboutmediv">
        <p class="intro"> My name is Bilal Khan and I am a Junior at Rutgers University-New Brunswick majoring in
            Computer Science.
            I am currently looking for any Fall, Winter, or Summer Software Engineering internships to gain more
            experince
            and utilize my coding abilities to increase my skills. I am very ambitious and outgoing and would love give
            a
            chance on any oppurtunity. Outside of coding and school, I have many hobbies I enjoy such as playing
            basketball,
            hiking, traveling, and photography.
